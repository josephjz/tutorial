        link to bootstap in the head of the html

        need to load static here 
        {% load static %} 
        <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "{% static 'accounts/style.css' %}" type = "text/css"> 
        type tells us that it is a css file
        but MOST IMPORTANT - this link is dynamic, and we are going to use templating language, called static, 
        to pass data from our django project to our templates
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class= "container">
            <h1> Welcome! </h1> You can login here. 
            <button class = "btn btn-danger" type = "button" name = "button"> Login </button>
        </div>
        <h1>{{name}}</h1> 
        what the line above does: takes the value from the view that we pass through and present it in the HTML template 
        <ul>
            ul for list, and then below is a for loop in the templating logic 
            {% for number in numbers %}
            <li>{{number}}</li>
            also need to end the for loop
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>  ALLL COMMMENTED OUT ABOVE FROM PREVIOUS VIDEOS - NEW CODE BELOW -->
